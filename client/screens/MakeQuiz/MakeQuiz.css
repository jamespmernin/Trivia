/* There will need to be ten questions added to a quiz (how do I validate that?) so to do that I need to make sure that when a user makes a quiz, they can give it the following:
A title
Their username associated with it
A text block to create a question
Four possible answers and a way to verify which answer is the correct one
This quiz should have full CRUD capability */
